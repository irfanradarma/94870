### Reflection
I attempt to keep the variables and colors in the visualization as simple as possible. In terms of variable selection, I arbitrarily chose countries that are quite influential in terms of economies of scale. I choose a line design since the information I'm seeking to convey in this visualization is a time series where there was a significant spike in 2019 (the cut-off I set for Covid). To avoid confusion with other variable lines, I made the cut-off line a neutral color (black). Because I want to emphasize that this increase occurred in OECD countries, I put a red line on the OECD variable and a gray line on the sample countries that I sampled.

If the message I want to convey is the context I chose, this is, in my perspective, clearer than the previous two visualizations. However, I realize that the OECD interface contains considerable information for more general and flexible application. Similarly, another grid line visualization. As a result, the context of the message to be conveyed with the data has a significant impact on the visualization approach chosen.
