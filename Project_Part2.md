# Project Story Board
by Irfan Radarma

This is the outline from the previous iteration of this project: [Project Outline](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/FinalProject)

## The Story Board
I created the draft of my story board using Shorthand.

Atau storyboard saya juga saya embed di akhir halaman ini. 

## The Feedback
### The Method
In trying to get feedback on my storyboard this time, I didn't have much time to meet and interact directly with my respondents. For that, I compensate with the quantity of feedback. So, the method I use is to request feedback indirectly to more than five respondents. The questions that I used in this iteration is the same one as the previous iteration, which are:
- Can you catch what the storyboard is telling you? Please elaborate in at least 2 sentences
- Do you feel overwhelmed by the visual or information given in the storyboard? If yes, please specify which of them
- Any concrete suggestions to improve what you think is not good enough?

### The Answer
The following is brief information about my respondents: (I will use this numbering code in the next discussion)
- [a] Female (30s), Grad Student
- [b]
- [c]

The benefit of conducting written interviews is that all responses are fully documented from the primary source. Here are their responses:
*Can you catch what the storyboard is telling you? Please elaborate in 2-3 sentences*
> - [a] The storyboard conveys the message of working style is now changing, that is towards the “digital nomad”. The data include the overall global trend and then dig down into digital nomad’s individual level, adding the concrete perspective and journey of how he become the digital nomad. Lastly, the story board provides the useful data for those who interested to become digital nomads.
> - [b] 

*Do you feel overwhelmed by the visual or information given in the storyboard? If yes, please specify which of them*
> - [a] I’m a little bit overwhelmed by the information detail specifically by the statistic report on location provided in the storyboard. But I think it will be useful for those who actually consider to become the real “digital nomads”

*Any concrete suggestions to improve what you think is not good enough?*
> - I don’t like the naked picture of a guys in the very beginning. And I think the figure font and visualization in tableau are having the different format as the website.
