# Project Story Board
by Irfan Radarma

This is the outline from the previous iteration of this project: [Project Outline](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/FinalProject)

## The Story Board
I created the draft of my story board using Shorthand.
Please visit this link to have a better experience viewing my storyboard: [shorthand.com](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/being-a-digital-nomad/index.html)

I also embed my storyboard at the end of this page. 

## The Feedback
### The Method
In the attempt to get feedback on my storyboard this time, I didn't have much time to meet and interact directly with my respondents. For that, I compensate with the quantity of feedback. So, the method I use is to request feedback indirectly to more than five respondents. The questions that I used in this iteration is the same one as the previous iteration, which are:
- Can you catch what the storyboard is telling you? Please elaborate in at least 2 sentences
- Do you feel overwhelmed by the visual or information given in the storyboard? If yes, please specify which of them
- Any concrete suggestions to improve what you think is not good enough?

### The Answer
The following is brief information about my respondents: (I will use this numbering code in the next discussion)
- [a] Female (30s), Grad Student
- [b] Male (20s), Grad Student
- [c] Female (30s), Grad Student
- [d] Male (30s), Public Employee
- [e] Female (30s), Public Employee
- [f] Male (30s), Grad Student

The benefit of conducting written interviews is that all responses are fully documented from the primary source. Here are their responses:
*Can you catch what the storyboard is telling you? Please elaborate in 2-3 sentences*
> - [a] The storyboard conveys the message of working style is now changing, that is towards the “digital nomad”. The data include the overall global trend and then dig down into digital nomad’s individual level, adding the concrete perspective and journey of how he become the digital nomad. Lastly, the story board provides the useful data for those who interested to become digital nomads.
> - [b] Yes, I am getting the gist of what the storyboard is telling. Particularly, right at the outset, I see four words: General, Andrew's story, location comparison, and B vs P, which makes my website journey predictable. I know what's coming as I will scroll down, keeping me engaged.
> - [c] Yes. The storyboard tells about being a digital nomad nowadays through surveys, comparisons, and historical data. The narration gives clear ideas about being a digital nomad through insightful information, complete with accessible recent data. At the end of the page, the readers are invited to get to know deeper about data research in terms of a digital nomad.
> - [d] The storyboard tells me about the factor that a future digital nomads need to consider before they decided to become one. In addition, it gives me an overview about the advantages and disadvantages of working remotely.
> - [e] Yes, it illustrates clearly the story of being digital nomad starting with its benefits and continuing with several aspects that should be put into consideration for anyone who want to join the tribe. This includes lower income, the large number of destination country options, and also the challenge and benefit of the destined country. Not only informative, I found the storyboard also engaging and entertaining with the data represented in various form (graphs, tables, and pictures). Overall, I can understand the storyboard with the data on it very easily.
> - [f] The storyboard tells me about the digital nomad. The page started with the definition and benefits of the digital nomad, continued with the thing that should be considered when choosing the right place, and why Bali is a suitable place to work remotely. The storyboard uses Andrew, a Pittsburgher who loves to work and travel, as the persona. It’s an informative storyboard, and I think helpful for aspiring digital nomads.

*Do you feel overwhelmed by the visual or information given in the storyboard? If yes, please specify which of them*
> - [a] I’m a little bit overwhelmed by the information detail specifically by the statistic report on location provided in the storyboard. But I think it will be useful for those who actually consider to become the real “digital nomads”
> - [b] No, I don't feel overwhelmed, however, I wish there were more descriptions. I feel I am moving pretty fast. I want some words to hold me down. That may just be my personal preference. 
> - [c] No. The visual is excellent. The concept visual will help the website readers get the information from the quantitative data, especially the combination of data from Tableau and narration and the location comparison, which gives a clear report related to the survey
> - [d] Not really. I love the picture transitions. Although there is one part, in my opinion, that could have more space in between. The part after comparing the regions and before it tells about Bali.
> - [e] No, the visual helps me understand the information. In my opinion, the combination of visual and written information is balance. So, no issue here.
> - [f] I feel overwhelmed by the location comparison page. There are two different charts that are presented side by side with little information and no distinct colour difference. 

*Any concrete suggestions to improve what you think is not good enough?*
> - [a] I don’t like the naked picture of a guys in the very beginning. And I think the figure font and visualization in tableau are having the different format as the website.
> - [b] The world map was blurry when I scrolled (and zoomed by default). You could use a more resolution photo. 
> - [c] I think the part of “Daily routine plan on Bali” can be improved, mainly through color or font size on the word “Not bad!”. The slide view on these parts does not quite fit if the readers scroll the page quickly. Also, part of the transition from the picture to memes, “Work-Travel-Repeat,” seems confusing since the transition is not smooth enough from picture to memes.  
> - [d] First, I need more time to understand the graphic about "Where Digital Nomads Reside". At first glance, I thought it was divided into two big parts, United States and Others. Maybe you can try a different colors to distinguish each country. Second, about "Living Cost: Bali vs Pittsburgh", for me it looks like a link to a three different articles about housing, utilities and food. And the last one, the problem that usually happens with using zoom in transitions, you've got to put a high definition picture so it wont be broken.
> - [e] I notice that the visual of “what people say about remote working” can be improve by making “flexible schedule” balloon bigger since it is considered the most important benefit by the respondent. It will help reader notice this survey result instantly. The other thing is, I personally think that it would be lovely if the “tableu” trademark and several symbols under visual can be can be removed.
> - [f] •	On Andrew Story: (1) Love the meme! It will be better if the meme appears when we hover over the picture than scroll the page because I can not read the sentence on that meme. (2) Clicking on the sweater redirect me to the Walmart website, it’s distracting me. On Location Comparison: (1) On the chart “Where Digital Nomad Reside”, I cannot find Portugal and Indonesia at glance. In my opinion, it’s better to take out “Others” in the Treemap diagram. (2) On the “Income Per Capita: Indonesia is Worth Looking For”, Indonesia’s and Thailand’s charts not showing up if I do not scroll down the chart. I think it’s better to make sure that all of the information on the chart is visible. It is also better if I know the meaning of the red and green bars on this chart. Overall: In my opinion, it will be better if there’s only one “Heading” on the page. No need to add “Heading” both in the text and chart on one page if they have the same messages.

### Reflection
Here's the summary of feedbacks worth noticing:
- The map picture I used for the zoom-in zoom-out feature is not high-res
- The meme appearance is not smoothly following the text it refers
- The chart used to tell the top-10 location where digital nomads reside is somehow questionable
- Tableau dimension is becoming a problem in different devices. Some part might be missing because of the smaller dimension device used to open the storyboard
