This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I have been working for the government in Indonesia since 2013.
I began my work as a data engineer and progressed to become an IT Auditor.

# What I hope to learn
I've always assumed that I know a lot about data visualization; I'd like to prove that I'm completely wrong.
I want to learn everything I can in this subject so that I can use data effectively as a communicator.

The following is the assignment I have done for the class:

### [Visualizing Government Debt](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/dataviz2)
Prof. Goranson instructed us to utilize General Debt data from the OECD website for this project. This assignment is divided up into three parts: 1) embed a visualization from the OECD website, 2) use the same data to build visualizations in Flourish, and 3) develop my own visualization in Flourish.
