This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I have been working for the government in Indonesia since 2013.
I began my work as a data engineer and progressed to become an IT Auditor.

# What I hope to learn
I've always assumed that I know a lot about data visualization; I'd like to prove that I'm completely wrong.
I want to learn everything I can in this subject so that I can use data effectively as a communicator.
