This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I have been working for the government in Indonesia since 2013.
I began my work as a data engineer and progressed to become an IT Auditor.

# What I hope to learn
I've always assumed that I know a lot about data visualization; I'd like to prove that I'm completely wrong.
I want to learn everything I can in this subject so that I can use data effectively as a communicator.

The following is the assignment I have done for the class:

### [Visualizing Government Debt](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/dataviz2)
Prof. Goranson instructed us to utilize General Debt data from the OECD website for this project. This assignment is divided up into three parts: 1) embed a visualization from the OECD website, 2) use the same data to build visualizations in Flourish, and 3) develop my own visualization in Flourish.

### [Critique by Design](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/critique_by_design)
In this assignment, we were asked to look for examples of poor dataviz, then critique them and rework them in accordance with the fundamentals we learned in this class.

### Final Project
#### [Part I: Outline](https://irfanradarma.github.io/94870/FinalProject)
This is the first part in my final project. I present a brief explanation of the project, complete with its structure, along with initial sketches. Furthermore, I give data sources as well as plans for methods and mediums for the final form.
