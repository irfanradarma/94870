This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I have been working for the government in Indonesia since 2013.
I began my work as a data engineer and progressed to become an IT Auditor.

# What I hope to learn
I've always assumed that I know a lot about data visualization; I'd like to prove that I'm completely wrong.
I want to learn everything I can in this subject so that I can use data effectively as a communicator.

## Visualizing Government Debt
### Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

### Reflection
I attempt to keep the variables and colors in the visualization as simple as possible. In terms of variable selection, I arbitrarily chose countries that are quite influential in terms of economies of scale. I choose a line design since the information I'm seeking to convey in this visualization is a time series where there was a significant spike in 2019 (the cut-off I set for Covid). To avoid confusion with other variable lines, I made the cut-off line a neutral color (black). Because I want to emphasize that this increase occurred in OECD countries, I put a red line on the OECD variable and a gray line on the sample countries that I sampled.

If the message I want to convey is the context I chose, this is, in my perspective, clearer than the previous two visualizations. However, I realize that the OECD interface contains considerable information for more general and flexible application. Similarly, another grid line visualization. As a result, the context of the message to be conveyed with the data has a significant impact on the visualization approach chosen.
