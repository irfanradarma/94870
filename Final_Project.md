Part III closes the previous iteration by concluding the iteration process of making this project and reflecting on the 1-minute pitch that has been done to deliver this project.

## The Last Adjustment (yet not least)
In general, I can say that my plan from parts I and II did not always work. However, the main idea, which is about digital nomads, could still be preserved. Part II saw me doing my best to materialize the ideas established in Part I, but some of them were unable to be fulfilled since I needed to adapt the idea to the features of the platform that I would use for the final deliverable (shorthand). The good news is that I realized in Part II that my earlier plan lacked credible data, so I incorporated additional survey data there.

I received a lot of extremely helpful feedback while working on Part III; from folks I interviewed, extensive in-class critiques, and eye-opening reviews from Prof. Goranson and his teaching assistant. In general, I discovered that I needed to make big changes to the idea of using personas that I outlined in Part I. Following the feedback, it seemed that using personas is not as simple as it appears, and I recognized that if the persona was not taken seriously it would lead to a biased narrative. I got the impression that Part III work was less reliable and biased when I tried to review it again. For that, I ditched the idea of personas and attempted to write this story from a more generic standpoint.

To get this broader standpoint, I subdivided the substance of my message into two categories (things to consider if my readers wish to become digital nomads), namely location and remote job. Instead of constructing my own story under the pretense of a fictitious persona, I researched and referenced digital nomad practitioners. It occurred to me that I had previously simply cited my data sources and not the narrative that had been constructed. It's no surprise that Part II was impressed with distorted information. Then, I was reminded of another student's question during the in-class critique session that I initially believed was unrelated to improvisation in Part II: "You intentionally lead the audience to believe that going to Bali is the best option?" See, a simple query that I overlooked as feedback or critique could instead indicate or confirm the most serious flaw in my earlier storyboard.

All in all, here is a summary of the storyboard improvements I made in Part III:

- Most of the prior Tableau visuals were replaced with Flourish and Canva
> takeway: Tableau is not particularly adaptable when it comes to embedding into a website. The major issue is the visualization's size or dimensions. Don't assume everything is alright just because you see it ok on your computer; in my experience, when presenting embedded charts, there can be substantial alterations such as label disappearance or small variable changes. Another thing, tableau seems overkill for simple data visualization (not many variables or dimensions), and I'd rather use Flourish (for common viz forms) or Canva (for viz forms with unique themes or iconizations)
-  Eliminate the persona, and the elements that go with it
> takeway: Personas should be used with greater caution. When you develop a persona from your own thinking, there is a trade-off, which is biases. Instead of presenting statistics and narration objectively, you may describe it like a magazine article you read the other day. The story may or may not be true (without the support of objective data).
- Re-map the key points that I want to convey (Location and Remote Job).
- Replaced low resolution images.

## 1-Minute Pitch Reflection
One minute is not an easy task, and I believe that practically all students that work on this project are aware of this. In my presentations, I aimed for a visual that is easy to grasp and has the potential to capture the audience's attention right away. Because there is a contrast comparison, I chose to exhibit a comparison graph of GDP per capita. I initially wanted to pick more than one graphic, but when I tried to write a narration for a one-minute pitch, it didn't seem possible (this is also influenced by language barrier because I took into account the possibility of being lost in translation in the middle of the presentation). As a platform for presentations, I did not use my shorthand page because I think scrolling down during the presentation is not very comfortable for the audience to see, moreover I will only show one graph plus my call to action. That's why I chose Canva as my presentation platform. In Canva, there are also many interesting presentation templates that make me even more excited to use them.

Next up, D-Day. The reflection on my performance of doing one-minute pitch in a nutshell is "panic". I must confess that I did not conduct much presentation practice. This caused the thought "time is running out" to cloud my mind during the presentation. I also mentioned something that I have tried to remember many times not to say it: "being a digital nomad is *always* a smart idea." When I was practicing, the word "always" came up, and I thought to myself, "I can't mention this." Let bygones, be bygones. As a result, I found myself wanting to speed up during a presentation. It felt too fast, but what matters is that I did not go over the time restriction.
