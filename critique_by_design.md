This graph was taken from CNN's website and is headlined "US hits 10th billion-dollar weather disaster of the year - at a record pace." The graph was obtained from the website of the National Centers for Environmental Information (embedded).

## Critique

### First Impression
When I initially looked at the graph, I noticed a lot of colors represented in small forms. The bright bar charts superimposed with colorful lines irritate me. Furthermore, the grid line makes it difficult for me to understand what the graph means. In a nutshell, it's really packed!

### Not a very helpful title
The graph already has a title, but reading it doesn't immediately assist me comprehend the context of the data being displayed. After more inspection, I discovered that this title is the default of the graphic included from the National Centers for Environmental Information website. Because the title is broad and impartial, it is understandable that it does not lead to a story. However, in the context of this news, the headline is not a reader's best buddy.

### What exactly is this legend about?
The legend underneath the title is made up of ten colors/components. I'm a little concerned based on the numbers; it appears that there are too many components for readers to keep track of. Something felt incorrect after I examined each of the components in the legend. The elements in the legend are not comparable variables. What I understand is that there are seven different types of disasters, one component is a composite of the seven different types of disasters, and the remaining two are statistical variables like confidence interval and a five-year average. These legends are then linked to the shapes used in the main section of the visualization, which is a separate issue that I'll go into in more detail later.

### Overcrowded
Let me recap the major component of the visualization: there are 10 colors represented by 7 color grid diagrams and 3 color lines that are stacked on top of each other. It is also worth noting that the total line is four since the variable confidence interval is divided into two lines, which I discovered after examining more attentively while frowning, indicating how difficult it is to see the components in this graph. The usage of vertical grid lines exacerbates the high number of colors and shapes used. There doesn't seem to be any empty space there, and there seems to be so much going on in that one box that it's difficult to focus on just on or a few.

### Context Analysis
What I understand is that the graph contains at least two main contexts, as shown by the presence of two y axes (number of events and cost in billions). In general, the article would like to point out that at the time of writing (mid-2020), the number of billion-dollar disaster events had reached an all-time high. Other graphics in the article can effectively support the narrative, as follows:

However, in the following explanation, the article addresses disaster incidents in specific places and shows a graph that I criticize on this occasion. To recapitulate, this graph is meant to detail disaster events by year. If such is the case, the information "number of events" appears to be more essential, whereas "cost in billions" appears to be unnecessary in this visualization. In my upcoming redesign attempts, I will apply that context assumptions.
